(* Entry points in the parser *)

(**
 * Provides a simple interface to the most common parsing entrypoints required
 * by editor/IDE toolchains, preprocessors, and pretty printers.
 *
 * The form of this entrypoint includes more than what the standard OCaml
 * toolchain (oprof/ocamldoc) expects, but is still compatible.
 *
 * [implementation_with_comments] and [interface_with_comments] includes
 * additional information (about comments) suitable for building pretty
 * printers, editor, IDE and VCS integration.
 *
 * The comments include the full text of the comment (typically in between the
 * "(*" and the "*)", as well as location information for that comment.
 *
 * WARNING: The "end" location is one greater than the actual final position!
 * (for both [associatedTextLoc] and [commentLoc]).
 *
 * Currently, the location information for comments is of the form:
 *
 *  (associatedTextLoc)
 *
 * But we should quickly change it to be of the form:
 *
 *  (associatedTextLoc, commentLoc)
 *
 * Where the [commentLoc] is the actual original location of the comment,
 * and the [associatedTextLoc] records the location in the file that the
 * comment is attached to. If [associatedTextLoc] and [commentLoc] are the
 * same, then the comment is "free floating" in that it only attaches to itself.
 * The [Reason] pretty printer will try its best to interleave those comments
 * in the containing list etc. But if [associatedTextLoc] expands beyond
 * the [commentLoc] it means the comment and the AST that is captured by
 * the [associatedTextLoc] are related - where "related" is something
 * this [reason_toolchain] decides (but in short it handles "end of line
 * comments"). Various pretty printers can decide how to preserve this
 * relatedness. Ideally, it would preserve end of line comments, but in the
 * short term, it might merely use that relatedness to correctly attach
 * end of line comments to the "top" of the AST node.
 *
 *    let lst = [
 *
 *    ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *         ----commentLoc-----
 *    ---associatedTextLoc----
 *
 *
 * Ideally that would be formatted as:
 *
 *    let lst = [
 *
 *    ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *
 * Or:
 *
 *    let lst = [ ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *
 *
 * But a shorter term solution would use that [associatedTextLoc] to at least
 * correctly attach the comment to the correct node, even if not "end of line".
 *
 *   (*    Comment    *)
 *   let lst = [ ];

  (* [loop_handle_yacc] mimic yacc's error handling mechanism in menhir.
     When it hits an error state, it pops up the stack until it finds a
     state when the error can be shifted or reduced.

     This is similar to Menhir's default behavior for error handling, with
     one subtle difference:
     When loop_handle_yacc recovers from the error, unlike Menhir, it doesn't
     discard the input token immediately. Instead, it restarts the parsing
     from recovered state with the original lookahead token that caused the
     error. If there is still an error, the look ahead token is then discarded.

     yacc's behavior gives us a chance to recover the following code :
     ```
     {
       let a = 1;
       Js.
     }
     ```
     , where "}" is the lookahead token that triggers an error state. With
     yacc's behavior, "}" will still be shifted once we recover from "Js.",
     giving the parser the ability to reduce the whole program to a sequence
     expression.
